    <h3>Pizza Pockets</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li> tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>8 ounces Italian turkey sausage</li>
        <li>1 cup tightly-packed arugula (about 1 ounce)</li>
        <li>4 ounces cream cheese, room temperature</li>
        <li>1/3 cup grated Parmesan, plus 1/4 cup</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (13.5-ounce) package of store-bought pizza crust (recommended: Pillsbury)</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour, for rolling out pizza dough</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups marinara sauce, store-bought or homemade</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat in a medium-sized, heavy skillet. 
            Add the sausage and cook until crumbled and golden, about 5 minutes. 
            Add the arugula and cook until wilted. Turn off the heat and let cool about 10 minutes. 
            Add the cream cheese, 1/3 cup Parmesan, salt, and pepper and stir to combine. 
            Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface to a thin 20 by 12-inch rectangle. 
            Cut the rectangle in half lengthwise. The cut each half into 8 equal rectangles.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spoon topping onto 1 side of each of the rectangles. Using a pastry brush, brush the edges of the rectangle with egg wash. 
            Close the rectangle of pizza dough over the topping. Use a fork to seal and crimp the edges. 
            Place the pizza pockets onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Brush the top of each pizza pocket with egg wash. 
            Sprinkle with the remaining Parmesan. Bake until golden, about 15 to 17 minutes.
        </li>
            Meanwhile, heat the marinara sauce over low heat in a medium saucepan. 
            Serve the hot pizza pockets with the marinara sauce alongside for dipping.
        </li>
