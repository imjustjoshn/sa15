    <h3>Pizza Pockets</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li> tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>8 ounces Italian turkey sausage</li>
        <li>1 cup tightly-packed arugula (about 1 ounce)</li>
        <li>4 ounces cream cheese, room temperature</li>
        <li>1/3 cup grated Parmesan, plus 1/4 cup</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (13.5-ounce) package of store-bought pizza crust (recommended: Pillsbury)</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour, for rolling out pizza dough</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups marinara sauce, store-bought or homemade</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat in a medium-sized, heavy skillet. 
            Add the sausage and cook until crumbled and golden, about 5 minutes. 
            Add the arugula and cook until wilted. Turn off the heat and let cool about 10 minutes. 
            Add the cream cheese, 1/3 cup Parmesan, salt, and pepper and stir to combine. 
            Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface to a thin 20 by 12-inch rectangle. 
            Cut the rectangle in half lengthwise. The cut each half into 8 equal rectangles.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spoon topping onto 1 side of each of the rectangles. Using a pastry brush, brush the edges of the rectangle with egg wash. 
            Close the rectangle of pizza dough over the topping. Use a fork to seal and crimp the edges. 
            Place the pizza pockets onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Brush the top of each pizza pocket with egg wash. 
            Sprinkle with the remaining Parmesan. Bake until golden, about 15 to 17 minutes.
        </li>
            Meanwhile, heat the marinara sauce over low heat in a medium saucepan. 
            Serve the hot pizza pockets with the marinara sauce alongside for dipping.
        </li>
    </ol>

<div id='Lasagna' class='recipe'>
    <h3>Lasagna</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound 80/20 ground beef</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>One 24-ounce jar marinara sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>One 16-ounce tub whole-milk ricotta (about 2 cups)</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan (about 4 ounces)</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella (about 8 ounces)</li>
        <li>12 no-boil lasagna noodles</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Add the ground beef, 2 teaspoons salt and a few grinds of pepper and cook, 
            breaking it up with a wooden spoon and stirring occasionally, until 
            the beef is browned and no longer pink in the middle, 5 to 6 minutes. 
            Pour in the marinara sauce and bring to a simmer. Lower the heat to medium and 
            continue to simmer until slightly reduced, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the balsamic vinegar 
            and butter and stir until the butter is melted. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, combine the ricotta, Parmesan, egg, 1 cup of the mozzarella, 
            1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a medium bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spoon 1/2 cup of the sauce onto the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch 
            baking dish. Lay 3 of the lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread a 
            third of the cheese mixture over the noodles, then spread a third of 
            the remaining sauce over top. Repeat 2 more times, then lay the last 3 
            noodles on top. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup mozzarella.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake until the noodles are softened, the cheese on top is melted 
            and turning brown in some spots and the sauce is bubbling around the edges, 
            about 30 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.
        </li>
    </ol>

<div id='Chicken Alfredo' class='recipe'>
    <h3>Chicken Alfredo</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>12 ounces fettuccine</li>
        <li>Olive oil, for tossing</li>
        <li>12 ounces boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 2) </li>        1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 pinches freshly grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and salt 
            generously. Add the pasta and cook according to 
            package directions until al dente (tender but still 
            slightly firm). Drain and toss with a splash of oil.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, slice the chicken into 1/4-inch-thick 
            strips, and lay them on a plate or a sheet of waxed 
            paper. Season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons 
            of the butter. When the butter melts, raise the heat to 
            medium-high and add the chicken in 1 layer. Cook, without
            moving the pieces, until the underside has browned, 1 to 
            2 minutes. Flip the pieces, and cook until browned and 
            cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer the chicken
            to a medium bowl.
        </li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining 6 tablespoons 
            butter. Scrape the bottom of the skillet with a wooden 
            spoon to release any browned bits. When the butter has 
            mostly melted, whisk in the cream and nutmeg and bring to 
            a simmer, then cook for 2 minutes. Lower the heat to keep 
            the sauce just warm.
        </li>
        <li>Whisk the Parmigiano-Reggiano into the sauce. Add the chicken 
            and cooked pasta and toss well. Season with salt and pepper. 
            Serve hot in heated bowls.
        </li>        
    </ol>
